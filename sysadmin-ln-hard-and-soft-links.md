# hard linkx

suppose file1 already exist

$ ln file1 file2

Hard links are very useful and they save space, but you have to be careful with their use, sometimes in subtle ways. For one thing, if you remove either file1 or file2 in the example, the inode object (and the remaining file name) will remain, which might be undesirable, as it may lead to subtle errors later if you recreate a file of that name.

# soft links

$ ln -s file1 file2

An easy way to create a shortcut from your home directory to long pathnames is to create a symbolic link.

Unlike hard links, soft links can point to objects even on different filesystems (or partitions) which may or may not be currently available or even exist. In the case where the link does not point to a currently available or existing object, you obtain a dangling link.
